    <p style = "font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-size:16px;font-style:italic;"><center> The basics to Offense. </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Hitting </li>
      <p style = "font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-size:16px;font-style:italic;"> For hitting a batter will step to the plate with an 0-0 count. The pitcher will do a wind up and throw you the ball. All you need to do is hit the ball if its a strike or watch it if it's a ball. </p>
      <li> Base Running </li>
      <p style = "font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-size:16px;font-style:italic;"> For base running you are forced to run if somebody is behind you and the ball is on the ground. If it is in the air pause and wait for it to hit the ground. If caught go back to your base. </p>
      <li> Signs </li>
      <p style = "font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-size:16px;font-style:italic;"> Before you step into the box look at your 3rd base coach for signs. There are certain indicators that are team based and if you coach gives you a sign you go it no matter what.</p>
       <li> Fielding</li>
        <p style = "font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-size:16px;font-style:italic;"> When fielding you will have to pick a position. Number 1 is the pitcher, 2 is the catcher, 3 is first base, 4 is second base, 5 is third base, 6 is shortstop, 7 is left field, 8 is center field, and right field is 9. Once you pick one of these positions you will need to find where home plate is in comparison. When the picher throws the ball be ready to get the ball to the appropriate place. For example if there is nobody on base and no outs. The ground ball hit to you at second will be thrown to first base. If the ball beats him to the base it is a force out and there will be 1 out nobody on.</p> 
    </ul>

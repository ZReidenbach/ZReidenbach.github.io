    <p> The basics to Offense. </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Hitting </li>
      <li> Base Running </li>
      <li> Signs </li>
    </ul>
     <p> For hitting a batter will step to the plate with an 0-0 count. The pitcher will do a wind up and throw you the ball. All you need to do is hit the ball if its a strike or watch it if it's a ball. </p>
     <p> For base running you are forced to run if somebody is behind you and the ball is on the ground. If it is in the air pause and wait for it to hit the ground. If caught go back to your base. </p>
     <p> Before you step into the box look at your 3rd base coach for signs. There are certain indicators that are team based and if you coach gives you a sign you go it no matter what.

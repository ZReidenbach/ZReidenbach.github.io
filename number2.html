      <p style="font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-size:25px;font-style:bold;"> When fielding you will have to pick a position. Number 1 is the pitcher, 2 is the catcher, 3 is first base, 4 is second base, 5 is third base, 6 is shortstop, 7 is left field, 8 is center field, and right field is 9. Once you pick one of these positions you will need to find where home plate is in comparison. When the picher throws the ball be ready to get the ball to the appropriate place. For example if there is nobody on base and no outs. The ground ball hit to you at second will be thrown to first base. If the ball beats him to the base it is a force out and there will be 1 out nobody on.</p>
